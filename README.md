Based on CANSAT 2024-25 requirements for the Software and telemetry integration, I created an application that a CANSAT team can use to create a ground station GUI, which would parse and plot the data in real time using PyQt. The Application currently utilizes a randomized dataset for quantities such as altitude and temperature changes over a 0.5-1 second time interval. It then plots this data over a lightweight protocol, such as serialized CSV or JSON, transmitted via UART or LoRa, to convey key sensor values.
